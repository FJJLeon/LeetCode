# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
In an array A of 0s and 1s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum S?

Example:
``` markdown
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
[*1,0,1*,0,1]
[*1,0,1,0*,1]
[1,*0,1,0,1*]
[1,0,*1,0,1*]
```

Note:
1. A.length <= 30000
2. 0 <= S <= A.length
3. A[i] is either 0 or 1.
